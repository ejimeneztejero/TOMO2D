# TomoGrids

- Author Clara Estela Jimenez Tejero (ejimenez@icm.csic.es)

## Overview
- This program converts the output data from Tomo2D into regular depth and time grids, using linear interpolation.
- It is used to compare WAS inversion models with a multichannel seismic line.
- To obtain reliable results, the grid size must be chosen carefully.
- For comparison with multichannel, dx must be the distance between CMPs (Common Midpoint).
- Parameter dz should be similar to the bathymetry resolution (good values between dz=0.01 and dz=0.001 km).
- Parameter dt should be the same as for multichannel.
- Velocities units are km/s, length, depth in km and time in seconds.

## Compilation:
- Automatic:
	make
- Manual:
	gfortran tt_grids.f90 -o tt_grids

## Execution on local computer, with example flags:
tt_grids -v vel.in -r refl.in -d dws.in -dx 0.00625 -dz 0.01 -dt 0.004

## Execution on clusters (e.g., cesga, script tomogrids_cesga.sh):
sbatch tomogrids_cesga.sh
It is parallelized with openmp. For more or fewer threads, change the number in the header line #SBATCH -c 20)

## FLAGS and UNITS
-Files and parameters are given through flags, directly on the command line:
        -flag "-v" for velocity tomo2d file (mandatory flag). 
        -flag "-dx" for resolution in x  (mandatory flag). 
        -flag "-dz" for resolution in z  (mandatory flag). 
        -flag "-dt" for resolution in time  (mandatory flag). 
        -flag "-r" for reflector files (optional flag). Add as many as you have, for example for 3 reflectors: "-r refl1.dat -r refl2.dat -r refl3.dat"
        -flag "-d" for dws file (optional flag)
        -flag "-rx" for x resolution or number of decimals, default is 5 decimals (optional flag)
        -flag "-rz" for z resolution or number of decimals, default is 3 decimals (optional flag)
        -flag "-rt" for time resolution or number of decimals, default is 3 decimals (optional flag)
        -flag "-rv" for velocity resolution or number of decimals, default is 3 decimals (optional flag)
        -flag "-rd" for dws resolution or number of decimals, default is 2 decimals (optional flag)

## OUTPUTS

- There are several outputs, always indicating the model name and the dx, dz and dt parameters.
- The formats for the outputs are:
	- Velocity output: x,z,v
	- dws output: x,z,dws
	- reflector output: x, refl
	- bathymetry output: x, bat
	- Velocity and bathymetry input also appear for you to check if they are correct

# Grid warnings
- If you get warnings that the grid is not very reliable, pay attention to them.
- Especially improve the dz, as it will better adjust all observables to the time grid.
